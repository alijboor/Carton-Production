# Carton-Production

This project is for a Future company that produces carton cups and where the client can send a special design to print on the cups.
This project has 3 users : admin , employees and client where each user has custom privileges.
1. admin sees all orders with the archived orders that were deleted from the client or by the admin himself.
2. an employee can see the orders depend on his role or privileges and can see the design and add the company comment to clients.
3. the client can add orders and see his orders and the status of the order and can delete orders in a custom case depending on order state.

The tables are dynamic depending on the data from the database.

Each client can have a special price for each item when he adds an order.


And so many details in this project.
